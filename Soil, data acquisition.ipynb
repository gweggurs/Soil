    "### Using Analysis and Predictive Modeling to find who could benefit the most from converting to Regenerative Agriculture practices.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This project started with the question: \n",
    "    \n",
    "   **Who can benefit the most from converting to regenerative agriculture?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "Regenerative agriculture means different things depending on context, but the principles I decided to focus on were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No-till farming to prevent topsoil erosion and to leave the soil biome undisturbed\n",
    "2. Swapping manufactured Chemical and Fertilizer inputs for increased biodiversity and livestock fertilization\n",
    "3. Cover cropping to enhance water infiltration and further prevent erosion \n",
    "\n",
    "No-Till agricultural practices and cover cropping have both been shown to have positive effects on soil health, reducing erosion, and improved moisture regulation--helping with both extreme drought and extreme moisture conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I dug into the question I decided to keep the scope limited to the United States. I wanted to have as much granularity as possible in defining the 'Who' in the question and decided to try to get data down to the county level for as many states in the USA as I could. \n",
    "\n",
    "I initially found data for the USDA's Census of Agriculture. The Census runs every 5 years and returns a myriad of agricultural statistics for all 50 states and the roughly 3,000 counties within the states. I found data for the total cost of Chemical and fertilizer inputs and decided to use this as my operating definition for the \"amount\" of conventional agriculture in a given county. These variables also provided the first data point for triaging the county or state that could benefit by  converting from conventional agriculture to regenerative:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **What areas have the highest costs associated with conventional Agriculture?**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Census data, I would be able to determine what states or counties spend the most on Chemicals and fertilizers, and therefore, the place that would be able to reduce their overhead costs the most if they removed those input from their way of farming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other aspect I wanted to address was risk. I found some data on changing weather patterns and debated using soil health measure or ground water levels, but in the end each area I examined for agricultural risk factors pointed toward drought. I found the US Drought Monitor and decided to use this as my second way of locating an area that would benefit from regenerative agriculture:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * **What areas have the highest risk of drought?**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Drought Monitor data I would be able to find the counties or states with the most frequent droughts--in other words, the places that could benefit the most from *mitigating* drought with improved soil health and water infiltration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final piece I wanted to incorporate into my project was predictive modeling of drought with machine learning. The modeling would include location data,  agricultural data, and the addition of basic weather data to predict the target variable of drought. Attempting to predict drought would potentially yield two benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, as long as I would be able to check what factors were most important in predicting drought, I could use those factors to further triangulate my search for the area in greatest need of cost and risk reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if the features used to predict drought allow for enough time for proaction, then the model could be used to catch warning signs of drought and give forewarning for at-risk areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling would provide the final piece:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **What factors are most important for predicting drought?**\n",
    "   \n",
    "In the end, I succeeded in answering each of these questions with insights from analysis and interpretation of machine learning models."
